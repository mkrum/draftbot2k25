# Standard League Draft Strategy Guide

## League Critical Information
- **Format**: Season-long standard fantasy football
- **13 Teams**: More competitive than standard 12-team leagues
- **Roster**: 1QB, 2RB, 3WR, 1TE, 2FLEX, 6BN (No K/DEF)
- **Scoring**: Half-PPR (0.5 per reception)
- **Playoffs**: Top teams make playoffs (weeks 15-17 typically)

## CORE STRATEGY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Best Player Available (BPA) with Positional Awareness
In standard leagues, draft the best overall value while maintaining roster balance. Don't reach for needs early, but be aware of positional scarcity.

### 2. Balance Floor and Ceiling
- Mix safe floor players with high-upside picks
- Early rounds: Proven production
- Middle rounds: Calculated risks
- Late rounds: Upside swings

### 3. Full Season Value
- Consider entire season including playoffs (weeks 15-17)
- Target players with favorable playoff schedules
- Account for all bye weeks, not just early ones
- Late-season strength of schedule matters

### 4. Depth and Flexibility
- Build depth at RB and WR for bye weeks and injuries
- Handcuffs become valuable for YOUR stud RBs
- Bench should mix immediate contributors and upside stashes

## POSITIONAL STRATEGY

### Wide Receiver Priority (Target: 5-6 WRs)
- With 3WR + 2FLEX spots, WR depth is crucial
- Target 2-3 WRs in first 5 rounds
- Mix target hogs with upside plays
- Both possession and deep threats have value

### Running Back Approach (Target: 5-6 RBs)
- Workhorse backs are premium in half-PPR
- Mix safe floor RB2s with high-upside RB3s
- Handcuff your top 2 RBs if possible
- Consider rookie RBs for late-season value

### Quarterback Strategy (Target: 1-2 QBs)
- In 1QB league, wait until rounds 7-12
- Target top 12 QB or wait for value
- Consider QB rushing upside
- Stack QB with a pass catcher if value aligns

### Tight End Approach (Target: 1-2 TEs)
- Elite TE (rounds 2-4) or punt (rounds 10+)
- Middle tier TEs offer poor value
- If punting, draft 2 TEs for flexibility

## PLAYER ARCHETYPES TO TARGET

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Three-Down RBs**: Complete backs with passing game work
2. **Alpha WRs**: True WR1s with 25%+ target share
3. **Ascending Players**: Second/third year breakout candidates
4. **Elite Offenses**: Players on top-10 scoring teams
5. **Contract Year/Prove-It Players**: Extra motivation

### VALUABLE TARGETS
1. **PPR Monsters**: High-reception players (7+ catches/game potential)
2. **Red Zone Threats**: TDs win championships
3. **Handcuff RBs**: Insurance for your studs
4. **Breakout Candidates**: New situation/opportunity
5. **Dual-Threat QBs**: Rushing floor with passing ceiling

### CALCULATED RISKS
1. **Injury Recoveries**: Discounted stars returning from injury
2. **Suspended Players**: Short suspensions = value
3. **Rookie WRs/RBs**: High draft capital rookies
4. **New Team Players**: Proven players in new situations
5. **Committee Backs**: If price is right

## ROUND-BY-ROUND STRATEGY

### Rounds 1-2: Foundation Studs
- Take proven elite players
- RB or WR based on value
- Avoid QB/TE unless generational talent
- Focus on consistency + upside

### Rounds 3-5: Core Starters
- Fill out RB/WR starters
- Consider elite TE here
- Look for value falls
- Target players with clear roles

### Rounds 6-9: Flex & Depth
- Last of reliable starters
- QB window (rounds 7-10)
- High-upside WR3/RB3
- First handcuffs if value

### Rounds 10-12: Upside & Insurance
- Backup QB if needed
- Handcuff your RB1/RB2
- Breakout candidate WRs
- Second TE if you punted

### Rounds 13-15: Lottery Tickets
- Rookie stashes
- Injured players returning
- Deep sleepers
- Your favorite upside plays

## VALUE OPTIMIZATION TACTICS

### Tier-Based Drafting
- Group players into tiers
- Draft last player in tier
- Move to different position when tier breaks
- Don't reach across tiers

### Positional Runs
- Anticipate and start positional runs
- Don't chase runs, pivot to value
- RB runs: rounds 3-5, 7-9
- WR runs: rounds 2-4, 5-7
- QB run: rounds 8-11

### Stack Considerations
- QB + WR1 from same team
- RB + DEF (if adding DEF)
- Avoid multiple players from bad offenses
- Correlation plays for ceiling weeks

## LEAGUE-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS

### 13-Team Impact
- Scarcity increased by 8%
- Reach slightly for last tier player
- Depth more valuable than 12-team
- Waiver wire thinner

### Half-PPR Adjustments
- Pass-catching RBs gain value
- Target hog WRs are gold
- TEs with high targets valuable
- Pure rushers lose some appeal

### No K/DEF Benefit
- 2 extra roster spots for skill players
- Can roster more lottery tickets
- Handcuffs more viable
- Deeper benches = more upside plays

## DRAFT DAY EXECUTION

1. Tier players by position
2. Mark high-value targets
3. Note stack opportunities
4. Identify league tendencies

### During Draft Tactics

- WR: 3 starters + 2-3 depth
- TE: 1 starter (+ backup if late)

### Bye Week Management

- Don't worry about bye conflicts after round 10
- Can stream through byes

## LATE ROUND STRATEGIES

### Upside Targets

## THE WINNING FORMULA
**Build a balanced roster with safe floors early, calculated risks in the middle, and high-upside swings late. In a 13-team league, depth matters more than hero picks. Target the sweet spot of proven production with remaining upside.**
