# Chopped League Draft Strategy Guide

## League Critical Information
- **Format**: Weekly elimination - lowest scoring team is eliminated
- **Players Released**: Eliminated teams' players go to waivers immediately
- **13 Teams**: More scarcity than standard 12-team leagues
- **Roster**: 1QB, 2RB, 3WR, 1TE, 2FLEX, 6BN (No K/DEF)
- **Scoring**: Half-PPR (0.5 per reception)

## CORE STRATEGY PRINCIPLES

### 1. Survival First, Championships Second
In Chopped leagues, you can't win if you're eliminated. Every draft pick must be evaluated through the lens of "Will this player help me avoid elimination in Weeks 1-4?"

### 2. Floor Over Ceiling
- Target players with consistent 12+ point weekly floors
- Avoid boom/bust players who could score 5 points and get you eliminated
- Proven veterans > Unproven upside in early rounds

### 3. Early Season Focus
- Weeks 1-6 are CRITICAL - you must survive the initial elimination rounds
- Avoid players with Weeks 1-5 byes
- Target players with easy early-season schedules
- Late-season playoff schedules are irrelevant if you're eliminated

### 4. Depth Over Stars
- Better to have 8 good players than 3 great players and 5 bad ones
- Every roster spot needs to be a potential weekly starter
- Handcuffs are luxury items you can't afford

## PLAYER ARCHETYPES TO TARGET

### MUST DRAFT
1. **Possession WRs**: High target share, consistent catches (Cooper Kupp types)
2. **Pass-Catching RBs**: 3-5 catches per game floor (Austin Ekeler types)
3. **Rushing QBs**: Added floor from rushing yards (Jalen Hurts types)
4. **Target Hogs**: Any player seeing 7+ targets consistently
5. **Good Offense Players**: Players on teams that score 24+ points/game

### MUST AVOID
1. **Boom/Bust WRs**: Deep threats with 2-catch games (DeSean Jackson types)
2. **Committee RBs**: Unpredictable touch distribution
3. **Injury Risks**: Players with recent soft tissue injuries
4. **Rookies**: Unproven players with variable usage
5. **Bad Offense Players**: Talented players on dysfunctional teams

## ROUND-BY-ROUND STRATEGY

### Rounds 1-3: Foundation
- Take the safest players available
- Prioritize proven producers over upside
- Mix of RB1/WR1 depending on value
- No QBs or TEs unless elite value

### Rounds 4-6: Floor Builders
- Target high-volume WR2s and RB2s
- Look for players with locked-in roles
- Consider elite TE if available
- Still avoiding QBs

### Rounds 7-10: Depth & QB
- Continue loading WR depth
- Take QB here (rounds 7-9 optimal)
- Flex-worthy RBs with passing game role
- Last chance for starting-caliber players

### Rounds 11-15: Upside & Insurance
- NOW you can take some upside swings
- Backup QB if needed
- Handcuffs to YOUR RBs only
- High-upside WRs with unclear roles

## ANTI-ELIMINATION TACTICS

### Weekly Floor Calculation
Before drafting any player, ask:
- What's their realistic worst game?
- Can I survive if 2-3 starters have floor games?
- Is this player startable Weeks 1-4?

### Bye Week Management
- NEVER have more than 2 starters on same bye
- Weeks 5-7 byes are optimal (you'll have waiver additions by then)
- Week 12+ byes don't matter (league likely over)

### Schedule Analysis
- Target players facing bottom-10 defenses Weeks 1-4
- Avoid players facing top-5 defenses early
- Early season matchups > Late season matchups

## WAIVER WIRE STRATEGY IMPACT

### Why Depth Changes Everything
- Stars from eliminated teams will become available
- Don't overpay for depth in draft - it's coming via waivers
- Focus draft capital on locked-in starters
- Bench should be upside plays, not mediocre veterans

## SPECIFIC DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS

### Green Light Players (Perfect for Format)
- High-floor PPR receivers with 8+ targets/game
- Dual-threat RBs with receiving upside
- Consistent veteran QBs with rushing ability
- Elite TEs with high target share

### Red Flag Players (Elimination Risks)
- Boom/bust deep threats
- TD-dependent RBs
- Rookie QBs
- Injured/questionable players
- Committee backfield RBs

## FINAL DRAFT CHECKLIST
Before each pick, confirm:
1. ✓ Does this player have a safe Week 1-4 floor?
2. ✓ Will they be a locked-in starter immediately?
3. ✓ Do they have consistent volume/opportunity?
4. ✓ Are they healthy and on a functional offense?
5. ✓ Can they score 10+ points even in bad games?

## THE GOLDEN RULE
**When in doubt, take the boring, consistent veteran over the exciting upside play. Championships are won by surviving, not by having the highest scoring week.**
