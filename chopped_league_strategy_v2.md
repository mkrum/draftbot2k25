# The Ultimate “Chopped” (Weekly Elimination) Draft Guide
Format: 13 teams • Half-PPR • 1QB, 2RB, 3WR, 1TE, 2FLEX, 6BN • 15 rounds • Snake • Lowest weekly score is eliminated

TL;DR
- Survive the first 4–6 weeks at all costs: draft for floor, early roles, and durability.
- Lock a high-floor QB and a top-10 TE or be willing to carry two streamable options early.
- Prioritize WR depth (you must start 3; 2 FLEX often become WR) and secure at least one dependable RB anchor.
- Avoid early bye-week clusters and boom/bust stacks until you’re safely midseason.
- Keep FAAB/liquid waivers to pounce when good teams get chopped.

Use this as a live-draft checklist: by round X, have Y. When in doubt, choose the safer weekly role over uncertain upside you can buy later from waivers.

## 1) Core Philosophy (Survival Math + Psychology)
- Your opponent each week is the league’s lowest score, not the field. Minimize your bottom tail.
- Variance kills: A team with a slightly lower mean but lower variance outlives a higher-mean, higher-variance team early.
  - Heuristic: If league weekly mean is ~120 and SD ~25, the expected lowest team in a 13-team week is roughly at 120 − 1.4×25 ≈ mid-80s. Early weeks are noisy; aim to clear 100+.
- Early stability > theoretical late-season upside.
- Plan to “buy” upside later: chopped teams’ rosters will feed waivers. Draft for floor, then use waivers to add ceiling once you’re safe.
- Reduce single points of failure (injury/role collapses) at RB and TE; protect your anchor pieces.

---

## 2) Positional Priorities and Roster Math
League-wide weekly starters minimum:
- QB: 13
- RB: 26 + some FLEX (often ~8–10 RBs)
- WR: 39 + most FLEX (often ~16–18 WRs)
- TE: 13 + occasional FLEX

Implications
- WR scarcity is real in practice: ~55–57 WRs start weekly. You need five startable WRs (3 starters + 2 FLEX depth) by mid-draft.
- RB fragility is high; you need at least one anchor and usable RB2/3 depth to avoid zeros.
- QB: one top-8 type notably cuts bottom-tail risk; punting QB increases weekly volatility.
- TE: Either secure a set-and-forget option or carry two steady streamers early.

---

## 3) Round-by-Round Strategy (15 Rounds)
Assume typical ADP dynamics. Use tiers; pivot if a run starts.

Round 1
- Goal: One foundational piece with weekly floor and bankable volume.
- Preference order (tie goes to the safer role):
  - Elite WR target hogs (25%+ target share profiles) OR true bellcow RBs (65%+ snaps, GL + receptions).
- Avoid: Pure deep-ball WRs and shaky committees.

Round 2
- Pair stability with stability.
- If WR in R1: add RB with secure workload (top-15 usage) or another alpha WR.
- If RB in R1: add a high-floor WR1/2 with elite route participation.
- Avoid: Early TE/QB reaches unless an elite falls past expected range.

Round 3
- Fill core starters with a third cornerstone.
- Priority: 2nd WR or 2nd RB (who can be your weekly RB2 immediately).
- If construction is WR/WR: this is the “Hero RB” window—grab a workload RB.
- Avoid: Rookies with uncertain snap ramps for September.

Round 4
- Target: 3rd WR or lock RB2.
- If an elite TE (projectable 7–8 targets weekly) falls, you can take him here.
- Consider QB if a top-5 floor/options slide.

Round 5
- Checkpoint: By now you want 3 WRs and 1–2 RBs.
- If TE cliff is approaching, take your TE1.
- If 7–8 QBs have gone, it’s time to join before the next run.

Round 6
- Depth that starts: WR4 with weekly role or RB3 with standalone touches.
- If you passed QB, secure a top-10ish with rushing floor now.
- Avoid: Handcuffs without standalone value unless it protects your own RB1.

Round 7
- Stabilizers: veterans with predictable roles (slot WRs, pass-down RBs with red-zone routes, TEs with 80% routes).
- If you skipped TE early, take TE1 here and plan to pair with TE2 later.

Round 8
- Flex insurance: WR5 or RB4 who can be started in a pinch Week 1–4.
- QB window closes soon—do not wait past the top 12 unless you’ll roster two.

Round 9
- Bye and Monday-night planning begins.
- Add your RB handcuff if it’s a clear one to reduce catastrophic risk.
- If you waited TE, grab TE2 with early targets (hedge volatility).

Round 10
- Role > upside: prioritize the player who will see snaps and targets in September.
- Consider QB2 only if you punted QB and will play matchups.

Round 11
- Contingent RB with a clean path to 15+ touches if injury strikes (yours or league-wide).
- WRs who are one injury away from 90% routes.

Round 12
- Specialist floors: slot WRs, hurry-up backs, high-route TEs.
- If you took an elite QB/TE, you can lean into more RB/WR depth instead of backups.

Round 13
- Early-season matchup tiebreakers: pick the guy with Weeks 1–3 routes/targets outlook.
- Add second handcuff only if your roster is otherwise stable and it protects a core starter.

Round 14
- Kicker/DEF are out—use this for another September starter-capable piece.

Round 15
- Final pick is a “plug-in if needed Week 1–2” player, not a long-developing project.
- If thin at RB: grab the highest-leverage contingent RB on your roster or a pass-down RB with 4–5 catch potential.

Draft Position Notes
- Early picks (1–4): Anchor RB or alpha WR, then pound WR/RB stability; you’ll often be set to take falling elite TE/QB values.
- Middle (5–9): Balance WR-WR or WR-RB starts; stay flexible and win the room’s value pockets.
- Late (10–13): Often WR-heavy start; plan to secure RB2 by R4–5; consider locking a top-8 QB/TE if they slide to stabilize the build.

Checkpoint Targets by Round
- R4: 3 starters at WR/RB minimum (ideally WR-WR-RB).
- R6: 3 WR + 2 RB + TE or QB.
- R8: 6–7 startable WR/RB combined, plus QB or TE.
- R10: Full starting lineup + 2 viable flex substitutes for September.

## 4) Player Archetypes: Target vs Avoid (with examples)
Note: These are archetype examples from recent seasons, not current-year picks.

Targets
- Target-hog WR1s: High route participation (>90%), stable aDOT, 25%+ target share. Example archetypes: Amon-Ra St. Brown, Keenan Allen in his prime.
- Workhorse RBs with receiving: 65%+ snaps, GL work, 10%+ target share. Examples: Christian McCaffrey-type, peak Joe Mixon usage.
- Mobile QBs with top-8 weekly floor: Rushing yards + red-zone carries. Examples: Jalen Hurts-type, Lamar Jackson-type.
- Every-down TEs or near-every-down with strong route rate (75–85%+): Examples: Travis Kelce-type, Mark Andrews-type.
- Slot WRs with bankable volume: High catch floors, chain-movers. Examples: prime Jarvis Landry role, Jakobi Meyers role.
- Pass-down RBs on fast-paced teams: 4–6 targets weekly plus two-minute drill.

Avoid (early rounds)
- Low-volume deep threats reliant on 2–3 bombs per week (volatile 3–120–1 vs 1–12–0).
- Early-down only RBs on likely losing teams (game-script risk, few receptions).
- Ambiguous committees without clear role separation in September.
- Rookies projected to “ramp up” by midseason—your risk window is Weeks 1–6.
- Heavy team stacks (QB + WR1 + WR2) early—great upside, but variance spikes the “lowest score” risk.

---

## 5) Risk Management (Minimizing Elimination Odds)
- Limit negative correlation early:
  - Avoid over-stacking; prefer mini-stacks (QB + one pass-catcher) only if they fell.
- Handcuff your own anchor RB(s):
  - In elimination formats, protecting a first/second-round RB is worth more than sniping someone else’s.
- Reduce injury/role risk:
  - Prioritize players without “questionable” tags and those returning from major injuries later at a discount.
- Weekly flexibility:
  - Draft 5–6 WRs you can start; they’re your FLEX safety valves.
- Monday-night hedging:
  - If comfortably above the projected elimination line by Sunday night, choose the safer Monday option.
  - If trailing, pivot to your higher-variance Monday play.
- Weather/late-breaking news:
  - In September, avoid fringe outdoor deep threats in extreme wind/rain; start slot/TE targets in those weeks.

---

## 6) Waiver Strategy (Leveraging the Chopped Pool)
General
- Expect one full roster to hit waivers each week; sometimes it’s a strong team. That’s your late-season upside source.
- FAAB (if used): Front-load but don’t empty early; survival > thrift.
  - Week 1–2: Spend 20–40% on a true difference-maker or a rescued RB1/WR1; 10–15% on stable starters.
  - Week 3–5: 25–50% when a top-24 overall piece appears.
  - Week 6+: Fewer competitors; elevate bids for players who fix your weakest weekly slot.
- Rolling waivers: Keep churn minimal early; only drop stable roles for improvements.
- Always replace volatility with role:
  - Waivers are where you swap a boom/bust bench WR for a 7–9 target starter.

---

## 7) Bye Week Planning
- Do not stack early byes among your core starters. A “bye-cliff” week is a classic elimination trap.
- Rule of thumb:
  - No more than two of your top 6 WR/RB sharing the same bye through Weeks 5–10.
  - If your TE bye matches that week, add a second TE earlier.
- Use chopped waivers to fix later bye overlaps; just don’t accept a Week 5–7 landmine out of the draft.

---

## 8) Late-Round Strategy (R11–15)
- Prioritize September utility over long-horizon bets.
- Ideal picks:
  - Contingent RBs with a single injury away from 15+ touches.
  - Veteran slot WRs with 80% routes who can start in Week 1–3.
  - TE2 with a 70–80% route role if you didn’t land an elite.
  - QB2 only if you punted the position and will stream by matchup.
- Avoid:
  - Multi-injury lottery tickets, suspended players, or rookies buried on depth charts until roles clarify.

---

## 9) Anti-Elimination Tactics (In-Season)
- Track the “line of death”: by late Sunday afternoon, estimate the bottom score. Set your Monday decisions accordingly.
- Start/Sit bias:
  - If projected comfortably above the line, take floor plays (high snap/route, low aDOT).
  - If below, switch to higher-variance options (deep threats, TD-dependent RBs).
- Manage late actives:
  - Have a Monday-night hedge on your bench when starting a questionable player.
- Consolidate risk:
  - Don’t rely on multiple players from the same real-life offense unless they’re elite; one bad NFL game shouldn’t sink your entire week.
- Injury contingency:
  - Keep at least one bench RB and one bench WR with startable Week 1–4 roles until the field thins.

---

## 10) Weeks 1–4 Survival Plan (Concrete Steps)
Pre-Week 1
- Audit your lineup for Week 1 roles (80%+ routes WRs, 60%+ snap RBs).
- Replace fringy boom/bust pieces with stable target earners via last-minute waivers.

Week 1–2
- Scoring target: Beat the projected bottom by 15–25 points.
- Lineup bias: Slot WRs, pass-catching RBs, mobile QB.
- FAAB: Be aggressive if a chopped team releases a top-24 overall piece. This is precisely why you drafted floor.

Week 3–4
- Tweak around real usage (routes, snaps, red-zone touches).
- If safe by Sunday afternoon, pivot to lower-variance Monday options.
- Keep 40–60% of FAAB if you haven’t needed it; spend if your team has a weakness that could create a floor hole.

---

## Edge Cases and How to Exploit Them
- Multiple good teams eliminated early:
  - Expect multiple studs on waivers. Spend sharply on the best positional upgrade to lower your weekly floor (e.g., elite TE or RB).
  - Consider dropping your most volatile piece to improve floor, even if you like the ceiling.
- Draft position extremes:
  - Early: You can secure a true anchor and then play value as it falls. You’re best positioned to pass on early QB/TE unless they slip.
  - Late: Often WR-heavy start; proactively secure RB2 by R4–5 and don’t miss the QB/TE stabilization windows.
- Weak NFL teams:
  - WR volume can still be safe (negative scripts = targets). Target-hog WRs on bad teams are okay.
  - Avoid early-down RBs on projected losing teams (touch floor collapses).
- Early-season schedule:
  - Tiebreaker only. Favor players with softer Weeks 1–3 defenses or high Vegas totals.
  - Avoid opening-month gauntlets for fringe starters; don’t overreact for elites.

---

## Practical Draft Board Heuristics
- WR Depth Rule: Draft 5 WRs you’re comfortable starting by Round 10.
- RB Stability Rule: Leave Round 6 with at least two RBs you can start weekly.
- QB Rule: If 8 QBs have gone by Round 6, get yours by Round 7–8.
- TE Rule: If you miss the elites, draft two top-15 route TEs by Round 11.
- Handcuff Rule: Prioritize handcuffing your own round 1–2 RB; de-prioritize random handcuffs early.
- Bye Rule: Avoid 3+ of your top 6 WR/RB sharing a bye before Week 10.

---

## Appendix: The Elimination Math (Intuition)
- With 13 teams, a truly “average” team has a 1/13 ≈ 7.7% chance to be last in any given week (higher in the noisy early weeks).
- Your goal is to reduce the probability mass below the elimination threshold each week.
  - Lower variance (floor plays, fewer stacks, stable roles) reduces the tail risk early.
  - Later, when the field shrinks and chopped waivers are rich, you can selectively add ceiling without exposing your floor.

---

## Final Checklist for Your Live Draft
- R1–2: Two bankable volume studs (at least one WR; plus RB anchor or second alpha WR).
- R3–4: Round out RB2/WR3; do not leave R4 without three dependable WRs.
- R5–8: Secure QB and/or TE at the value cliff; add startable WR4/RB3.
- R9–12: Handcuff your anchor RB, add TE2/QB2 if needed, and stack September roles.
- R13–15: Early-season plug-ins and high-leverage contingency RBs.
- After the draft: Map Weeks 1–4 lineups and byes; earmark FAAB for the first surprise chop.

Build a team that refuses to bottom out in September. Then use the ever-improving waiver pool to get scary. That’s how you survive—and win—Chopped.
